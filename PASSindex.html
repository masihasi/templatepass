  The Persian audio source separation project aims to separate two or more audio files from one audio containing two or more audio sources. Consider a audio file of a meeting in which four people are talking at the same time, and background music is playing; the final product of this project should be able to output five separate audio files, each containing one sound from one of them. Among these audio sources (4 people and a music source). The library in the references section is an open-source project ready for this work. This project may be enough for us (it may not depend on the language). Necessary measures should be taken to personalize it for the Persian language. After preliminary research and making a demo in the Persian language, it is time to test the product. It is placed as a research product in the field of sound processing. It is expected that an initial report will be posted on the company's blog after the research, and the community of this report and weekly reports will also make the project's final report.
